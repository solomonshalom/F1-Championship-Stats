# Contributing Guidelines

## Opening an issue

<br>
First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! ‚ù§Ô∏è<br><br>
All types of contributions are encouraged and valued. Please make sure to read the relevant section before making your contribution. It will make it a lot easier for us maintainers and smooth out the experience for all involved. The community looks forward to your contributions. üéâ

Here are a few things that will help us help resolve your issues:

- A descriptive title that gives an idea of what your issue refers to
- A thorough description of the issue, (one word descriptions are very hard to understand)
- Screenshots (if appropriate)
- Links (if appropriate)
  <br><br>
  
And if you like the project, but just don't have time to contribute, that's fine. There are other easy ways to support the project and show your appreciation, which we would also be very happy about:

- Star the project‚≠ê
- Tweet about it‚ú®
- Refer this project in your project's readmeüëçüèª
